# Tail_Concerto_Logos_And_Fan-Made_Encore_Versions
[Concerning Previewing These SVG Files In A Web Browser]
It wasn't until as I was exporting these to SVG that I learned first-hand that when viewed in a web browser:
* Gradient meshes inside clipping masks are invisible, or that they don't render
* Objects using blending modes render as "Normal" instead
HOWEVER, please rest assure that the SVG files still contain the data and displays it correctly in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. 
So you can still export it as large a raster image your computer can handle and it will still dislay correctly.

The image files contained within this repository are vector images I made of the logos from Tail Concerto, a Playstation 1 game. 
The aforementioned game was published by Bandai Namco, developed by CyberConnect2, and is part of the larger Little Tail Bronx world/lore. 
I have also took it upon myself to create a version of the logo called Tail Concerto Encore. 
My versions of "Tail Concerto Encore"/"テイルコンチェルトアンコール" does not represent a product in development. 
My versions of "Tail Concerto Encore"/"テイルコンチェルトアンコール" are fan-made non-commercial projects of concept art that visualizes what a remake might look like. 
For this project, I also provided the Adobe Illustrator file that shows my creative process behind the building of the vectors.
